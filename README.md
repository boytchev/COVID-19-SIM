# COVID-19-SIM

I started to build a COVID-19 simulator from scratch. Simulation is based on a reasonably detailed social behaviour. I track my decision path [here](https://twitter.com/PavelBoytchev).

The simulator is still not ready for a general use &ndash; it is still under heavy development. However, you can try the [Simulator](https://boytchev.github.io/COVID-19-SIM/covid-19-simulator.html). The simulation is controlled by over 130 parameters. The [Configurator](https://boytchev.github.io/COVID-19-SIM/covid-19-configurator.html) is used to inspect and update these parameters.
