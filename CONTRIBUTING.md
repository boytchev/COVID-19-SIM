As the project is still in an early development and there are many undocumented ideas,
before making any contribution to the code, please, discuss it in [Discussions](https://github.com/boytchev/COVID-19-SIM/discussions).
This is to avoid situations that contributors write code, that is rejected, because of conflict with undocumented ideas.
